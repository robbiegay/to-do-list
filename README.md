# Robbie's To-do List

Good for remembering your grocery list!

## Getting Started

Type entries that you want to add to your to-do list. Add your item to the list by pressing enter/return. Your list item will now be added to the to-do list below â€” you can now continue adding other items to the list. 

You can mark items as completed or uncompleted via the checkboxes to the left of each to-do list item.

Below the to-do list are three view option buttons:
- view done (checkmark emoji)
- view all
- view to-do (x emoji). 

While in each view state, checking or unchecking list-items will cause the to toggle between visibilities. For example, in the 'done' view-state: only items checked 'done' will appear. In this state, adding new items to the list will appear to do nothing. This is because new items are, by default, unchecked. You can view these newly added items by selecting either of the other two view-states.

You can hover over the toggle-state buttons to see how many many list-items there are in each state.

Below the view-state buttons are toggle-all (toggle button emoji) and delete (bomb emoji) buttons. The toggle-all will check or uncheck all of the to-do list items. If there are any unchecked items, then all items become checked. If all items are checked, then all items become unchecked.

## Running the tests

Some issues that I ran into and tried to solve for:
- Long inputs: Long input values cause the input box to start scrolling. Once entered, the input is broken into a new line to prevent the new list-item from running off the screen. If a long input is entered WITHOUT any spaces, then the checkbox will appear on its own line. This is a somewhat undesirable result, but it seems rather unlikely that there would be such a long input without spaces.
- Spaces: You cannot enter blank list-items. Additionally, adding excessive spaces before, after, or in the middle of a list item will be trimmed down to single spaces.
- View State Issues

During the development process, because local storage doesn't reset on a page reload, I thought it would really useful to have a keystroke that reset local storage and a keystroke to display certain console.log()'s. I mapped the '=' key to clear both the local storage and the array containing my list-item objects. I mapped the '-' key to display various useful console.log()'s. Both of these functions have been commented out in the live version of the program.
