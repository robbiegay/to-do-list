# Robbie's To-do List

Good for remembering your grocery list!

## Getting Started

Type entries that you want to add to your to-do list. Add your item to the list by pressing enter/return. Your list-item will now be added to the to-do list (in the space below the input box). You can now continue adding other items to the list. New items are added to the bottom of the to-do list.

You can mark items as completed or uncompleted via the checkboxes to the left of each to-do list-item.

Below the to-do list are three view-state buttons:
- View done (checkmark emoji)
- View all
- View to-do (x emoji). 

While in each view-state, checking or unchecking list-items will cause them to toggle between visibilities. For example, in the 'done' view-state: only items checked 'done' will appear. In this state, adding new items to the list will appear to do nothing. This is because new items are, by default, unchecked. You can view these newly added items by selecting either of the other two view-states. View states do not save between page reloads â€” the default view state is "view all".

You can hover over the toggle-state buttons to see how many list-items there are in each state. On mobile, the numbers will stay visible after a click on any of the view-state buttons, and will toggle back to their original state upon a click of the toggle-all button, delete button, any of the checkboxes, or the input field.

Below the view-state buttons are the toggle-all (toggle button emoji) and delete (bomb emoji) buttons. The toggle-all button will check or uncheck all of the to-do list-items. If there are any unchecked items, then all items become checked. If all items are checked, then all items become unchecked.

The delete button will remove any currently checked items from the to-do list.

## Running the tests

Some issues that I ran into and tried to solve for:
- Long inputs: Long input values cause the input box to start scrolling. Once the item is entered, the item is broken into a new line to prevent the new list-item from running off of the screen. If a long input is entered WITHOUT any spaces, then the checkbox will appear on its own line. This is a somewhat undesirable result, but it seems rather unlikely that there would be such a long input without spaces.
- Spaces: You cannot enter blank list-items. Additionally, adding excessive spaces before, after, or in the middle of a list-item will be trimmed down to single spaces.
- View State Issues: As mentioned in the "Getting Started" section, depending on your current view-state, certain items will need be update in real time. Checking or unchecking list-items may cause them to disappear depending on your current view-state. Entering new list-items will cause them to disappear in the "done" view-state. The toggle-all button will also cause list-item visibility to change.

Because local storage does not reset on a page reload, I found it useful throughout the development process to have a keystroke that would reset local storage and a keystroke that would display some useful console.log()'s. I mapped the '=' key to clear both the local storage and the array containing my list-item objects. This was useful when I had made changes to the code and wanted to quickly test these changes with a completely reset webpage. I mapped the '-' key to display various useful console.log()'s. Both of these functions have been commented out in the live version of the program.
